    "description": "This plug-in is used to trigger a Dynamic Action cyclic, e.g. to reload a region every 10 seconds. The timer can be set statically or per item value. Using the item value feature the timer can be stopped or reset by changing the item value. IMPORTANT: The timer fires an event on the selected Affected Element so it is advisable to use only one trigger per element, but you have enough elements on the page and it doesn't matter which one you use, e.g. the region that is updated or a page item.<p><b>Important clarification: My work in the development team of Oracle APEX is in no way related to my open source projects or the plug-ins here on apex.world! All plug-ins are built in my spare time and are not supported by Oracle!</b></p>",
